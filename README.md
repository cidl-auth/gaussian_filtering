# Explicit Bandwidth Learning for FOREX Trading Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Model for explicit bandwidth learning for FOREX Trading


## Overview
This repository contains a practical tool that employs Gaussian filters to denoise FOREX data using explicit bandwidth learning.
We provide an open source implementation of the layer applying the Gaussian filters can be used in an DL-based trading pipeline.
